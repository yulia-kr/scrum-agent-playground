# Scrum Agent Playground

An interactive project for experimenting with AI agents to automate Scrum processes — from analyzing a feature to creating well-structured backlog tickets.

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates how **multi-agent AI workflows** (built with [Crew AI](https://www.crewai.com/)) can:
- Read and understand a feature description
- Learn from examples of well-written Scrum tickets
- Generate new backlog items in a consistent style
- Add acceptance criteria, dependencies, and priority suggestions

The goal is to provide a **hands-on playground** for learning and testing how AI agents can be orchestrated to work together on real-world Agile tasks.
